# hello-world
My first repo. Boring stuff inside.
Programming languages I have mastered so far? None, but I know a little Python, JavaScript and C. HTML, CSS and jQuery are not strangers to me, too.
Running Linux Mint and Windows 7. Why? Variety is the spice of life... ok, seriously, it's just that I can't help playing Half-Life and other great games at times.
